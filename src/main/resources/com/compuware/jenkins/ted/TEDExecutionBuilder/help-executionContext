<div>
The name or absolute path to the execution context file. The execution context file can supply some of the arguments that can also be passed with the execute command. If a value of a certain parameter is present in the context file and is also passed as an argument, the value passed with the command will take precedence. To know which all parameters can be specified via the context file, view the template provided at <InstallPath>/WorkbenchCLI/EnterpriseData namely executioncontext_template.properties. Multiple execution contexts can be created as required by copying the template.
<p/>Optional? Yes
