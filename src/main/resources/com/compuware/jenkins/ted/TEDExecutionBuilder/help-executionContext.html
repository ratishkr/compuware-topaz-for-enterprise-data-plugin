<div>
TThe name of the execution context file. If the file is present at <InstallPath>/WorkbenchCLI/EnterpriseData, the name of the file would suffice, if at a different location on the machine supply the full path with the file name. If a value for a certain argument is defined in the context file and is also passed as an argument, the value passed with the command will take precedence. To know which all parameters can be specified via the context file, view the template provided at <InstallPath>/WorkbenchCLI/EnterpriseData named executioncontext_template.properties. Multiple execution contexts can be created as required by copying the template.
<p/>Optional? Yes, if this is not provided all other mandatory parameters have to be defined on the pipeline definition.
